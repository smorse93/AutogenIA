Would you like to outline the summarized list of suggested partners and resources and determine whether to Build, Ally, or Buy these resources and partnerships?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
capabilitiesManager (to chat_manager):

Certainly, summarizing the suggested partners and resources for the Nike Move app digital offerings:

1. **Fitness Instructors and Coaches**
2. **Health and Wellness Brands**
3. **Technology Providers**
4. **User-Generated Content Platforms**
5. **Data Analytics and AI Companies**
6. **Athletic Events and Organizations**

The decision to Build, Ally, or Buy these resources and partnerships involves careful consideration of various factors, including the core competencies of Nike, the speed of execution, and the strategic nature of each partnership.

Here's a brief approach for each category:

1. **Build:** If a resource or capability is closely aligned with Nike's core strengths and innovation is a differentiator, building the capabilities in-house might be the best option. This can ensure a high level of customization and control over the developed resources.

2. **Ally (Partnerships):** For resources and partnerships that complement Nike's offerings and brand image, forming alliances could be beneficial. This approach can leverage the expertise of external partners without direct ownership, allowing for flexibility and shared benefits.

3. **Buy:** In cases where specific capabilities or resources are critical, but building or allying might be time-consuming or less viable, acquiring companies or capabilities could provide immediate access to the needed resources.

The decision on whether to build, ally, or buy should align with the long-term strategy of Nike and the potential impact of the partnerships and resources on the digital offerings.
