Admin (to chat_manager):

You are a consulting firm working with your client: Nike. Your job is to create 3 completely new, innovative and unexpected digital products that millions of athletes would find desirable. Each must fit inside of a new app 
called Nike Move. This app helps any level of athelte stay moving. Each of the three offerings must have a digital element people would pay for and compel the athlete to buy other Nike products. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planner (to chat_manager):

Plan for Nike Move App Development:

1. **Initial Research and Understanding Phase** (UserExperienceManager):
   - Conduct deep market research on existing athletic apps.
   - Interview a diverse group of athletes across different sports to understand their digital needs.
   - Research current technology trends that could be applied to athletic training and performance monitoring.

2. **Brand Alignment and Strategy** (BrandManager):
   - Ensure new digital offerings are aligned with Nike's brand image of innovation, inspiration, and high performance.
   - Develop branding strategies for Nike Move to seamlessly integrate with Nike's existing product lines.

3. **Profitability Analysis** (ProfitManager):
   - Identify potential revenue models for the digital offerings (subscriptions, in-app purchases, premium features).
   - Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to ensure profitability while providing value to the users.
   - Explore ways the app can incentivize users to purchase Nike gear.

4. **Capabilities Assessment** (CapabilitiesManager):
   - Assess Nike's current technical capabilities for developing and supporting the Nike Move app.
   - Determine the need for additional technological infrastructure or partnerships to bring the app to life.

5. **Partnership Development** (PartnersManager):
   - Identify key partners for technology, content, and licensing to enhance the features of Nike Move.
   - Formulate strategies for co-branding and cross-promotions with fitness and technology brands.

6. **Channel Identification** (ChannelManager):
   - Pinpoint the most effective channels to deliver and market the Nike Move app, considering Nike's target audiences.
   - Plan for the integration of the app with other digital platforms such as social media, Nike websites, and online forums.

7. **Offerings Development** (OfferingsManager):
   - Devise three innovative digital offerings:
     a. **Custom Training Program Builder**: An AI-powered feature that creates personalized training programs for users, which adapt over time to their performance metrics and goals.
     b. **Virtual Gear Closet**: A digital wardrobe where users can virtually try on and purchase the latest Nike gear. Integration with augmented reality tech can enhance this experience.
     c. **Global Nike Challenges**: Timed challenges that allow users to compete with athletes globally. Completing challenges earns points that can be redeemed for Nike products or exclusive digital content.

**Tentative Timeline for Implementation**:
- Research and Planning (UserExperienceManager, BrandManager, ProfitManager, CapabilitiesManager, PartnersManager, ChannelManager, OfferingsManager): 3 months
- App Development and Testing Phases: 6 months
- Marketing and Partnering Strategies Implementation: 3 months
- App Launch and Monitoring: Continuous post-launch with periodic assessments

**Feedback Iterations**:
After presenting the plan, I would request feedback from both the admin and critic roles. Adjustments will be made based on that feedback concerning the feasibility, brand alignment, profitability predictions, capabilities, partnerships, delivery channels, and appeal of the proposed offerings. The goal is to refine this plan iteratively until the admin approves it, ensuring it aligns with Nike's strategic objectives and the needs of its athletes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critic (to chat_manager):

As a critic, reviewing the planner's submission, there are several elements that I would like to address:

1. **Market Research**: The Initial Research and Understanding Phase should also include an analysis of potential legal and regulatory considerations around data privacy, especially considering the AI aspects and digital wardrobe functionalities where personal data will be used.

2. **Brand Alignment and Strategy**: The planner has addressed brand alignment and strategy correctly. However, it would be beneficial to include potential risks or challenges that could affect the brand, such as user reception of digital products and data security concerns.

3. **Profitability Analysis**: The profit manager should also consider the lifetime value of the customer and how these digital offerings will impact this. It's crucial to not just think of immediate profitability but long-term customer engagement and retention.

4. **Capabilities Assessment**: Instead of only assessing Nike's current technical capabilities, this phase should also include a gap analysis to understand which new capabilities Nike will need to develop or acquire.

5. **Partnership Development**: Mention of partnerships is good, but there should also be criteria for selecting partners, ensuring they align with Nike's values and have the ability to scale with the project.

6. **Channel Identification**: The plan should include specifics on how the integration with other digital platforms would look and how it can be optimized for better user engagement and tracking of marketing effectiveness.

7. **Offerings Development**: 
   a. **Custom Training Program Builder**: The AI feature is interesting, but more information on how it would function and differentiate from other training apps is needed.
   b. **Virtual Gear Closet**: This is innovative, but it should address how it will entice users to pay for the feature and its synergy with existing e-commerce strategies.
   c. **Global Nike Challenges**: The gamification strategy has potential, but careful consideration should be given to how these challenges can cater to and motivate athletes of different levels. Additionally, there has to be an attractive balance between free and premium content to ensure wide adoption.

**Other Considerations**:
- **User Data and Analytics**: The app should include a comprehensive data analytics framework to capture and analyze user interaction data, which will be instrumental in iterating and improving the app over time.
- **Marketing and Launch Strategy**: The app's marketing and launch strategy should be developed more thoroughly, with specific campaigns or promotions outlined to ensure a successful launch.

**Verifiable Information**: The plan currently does not include any citations or sources for the market research or technology trends, which would further support the claims and strategies proposed.

**Final Remarks**: Overall, the plan is well thought out and covers many essential elements for developing a digital product. However, it would benefit from deeper dives into both the technical aspects and the execution strategy for user engagement and monetization. Adding more concrete, verifiable data and sources would enhance the plan's credibility.
